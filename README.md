## Snake Game

This is a classic Snake game built using the Turtle graphics library in Python. The game involves controlling a snake that grows in length as it eats food. The objective is to keep the snake alive for as long as possible by avoiding collisions with the walls and the snake's own body.

### Features

- Simple and intuitive gameplay
- Increasing difficulty as the snake grows longer
- Keeping track of the highest score
- Smooth animation and responsive controls

### How to Play

1. Use the arrow keys (w, s, a, d) to control the direction of the snake.
2. The snake will automatically move in the direction you choose.
3. Eat the red food to grow the snake and increase your score.
4. Avoid colliding with the walls or the snake's own body.
5. The game ends when the snake collides with the walls or its own body.

### Installation

1. Make sure you have Python and the Turtle graphics library installed.
2. Save the code in a file with a `.py` extension, for example, `snake_game.py`.
3. Run the Python script using the command `python snake_game.py` in your terminal or command prompt.

### Customization

You can customize the game by modifying the following aspects:

- **Snake and food appearance**: Change the shape, color, and size of the snake and food by modifying the `shape()`, `color()`, and `goto()` methods.
- **Game window settings**: Adjust the window size, background color, and title by modifying the `Screen()` and `bgcolor()` methods.
- **Difficulty level**: Modify the `delay` variable to change the speed of the snake and adjust the game difficulty.

### Future Enhancements

In the future, I plan to explore and implement various path-finding algorithms to enhance the snake's movement and decision-making. This could include algorithms like A* (A-star), Dijkstra's algorithm, or Breadth-First Search (BFS). By incorporating these algorithms, the snake's behavior can become more intelligent and strategic, providing an even more engaging gameplay experience.
